ATM Simulator in Java

This Java-based ATM simulator project provides a console-based interface for users to perform basic banking transactions.
The implementation consists of two main classes - `ATM` and `BankAccount`. 
The `ATM` class facilitates user transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks, connecting to the `BankAccount` class, which manages the user's account details.
The console interface offers simple options for users, including withdrawal, deposit, checking balance, and exiting the ATM. 
The project encourages exploration and modification for further customization. Feel free to enhance the code and contribute to its development.
